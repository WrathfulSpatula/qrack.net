## qrack.net

This is the future home of the OSS qrack.net codebase, to demonstrate simple [vm6502q/qrack](https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack) quantum computer simulator library benchmarks executed in any web browser. For now, it contains a Qrack quantum Fourier transform (QFT) bound method, wrapped in the example code from the Emscripten SDK. (It is not yet fully functional.)
